# cmd basics
- cd: change directory
- mkdir: make directory
- touch: make new file
- cat: show contents of file
- rm -rf : remove a file

# All the commands used in Github

# adding new file to repo

- git init
- git status
- git add .
- git commit -m "message here"
- git log


# upstaging / deleting commits

- git reset hash_id : removes or upstages all the commits ABOVE this commit 

# stashing modifications: let's say we modified a file, however we do not want to commit the changes, nor do we want to lose these changes, for this we use STASH in git, which allows to save these modifications in a backstage, from where these can be called (or cleared) as and when required

- git add .
- git stash : saved to the backstage
- git stash pop: bring to the tracked files area, ready to be committed
- git stash clear: remove the modifications and delete from the backstage


# working with a online Github repo:

- git remote add origin github_url : to link local with remote(url) GitHub
- git push origin main: add the staged (committed) files to the remote GitHub)

# branches in GitHub:

- default branch name is master
- git branch: find out which branch currently on
- git branch b_name : add branch 
- git checkout b_name : switch to branch b_name

# open source works: forking, pull requests

- while contributing to a open project, you cannot make changes directly to the owner repo; rather fork the repo to your own account
- git remote add origin forked_url
- got remote add upstream owner_url

- create separate branch for each feature
- never commit on main branch
- create a pull request
- if there is a difference in files in the local and remote repo, we'll have to force push it: git push origin main -f

# to make sure the main of fork is updated wrt the main of upstream:
- git checkout branch
- git fetch --all --prune
- git reset --hard upstream/main
- git push origin main
- git pull upstream main

# squash commits: add multiple commits into a single commit

- git rebase -i hash_id
- p : pick to commit
- s : squash with previous commit

# merge conflict:
- override manually
